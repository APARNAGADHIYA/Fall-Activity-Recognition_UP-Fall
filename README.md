Images can be taken from this publicly available dataset.
AlphaPose method is used to extract skeleton keypoints for each activity. The output obtained is in json fromat which is further converted to Excel data sheet.
Machine Learning Algorithms like SVM, KNN and MLP are used to train and test the system.
